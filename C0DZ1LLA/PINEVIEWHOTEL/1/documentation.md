**Booking System Documentation**

**1. Introduction:**
The booking system is a web-based application designed to facilitate the booking process for Pine View Hotel. It allows users to make reservations for rooms at the hotel by providing their arrival and departure dates, selecting the desired room type, specifying the number of guests (adults, children, infants), and indicating any special group requirements.

**2. Features:**
- **User-friendly Interface:** The system provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for users to input their booking details.
- **Room Selection:** Users can choose from various room types available at the hotel, including Double Room with Mountain View, Twin Room with Mountain View, Deluxe Double Room with Balcony, Single Room, Suite, Double Room, and Suite with Balcony.
- **Date Selection:** Users can select their arrival and departure dates using a date picker, ensuring accurate booking dates.
- **Guest Information:** Users can specify the number of adults, children, and infants accompanying them during their stay.
- **Group Booking:** For group reservations, users can indicate their group number.
- **Real-time Availability:** The system checks the availability of rooms based on the selected dates and room type, ensuring that users are informed if their desired accommodation is available.
- **Total Price Calculation:** The system calculates the total price for the booking based on the selected dates, room type, and number of guests.
- **Confirmation and Feedback:** Upon successful booking, users receive confirmation of their reservation along with the total price and booking details. In case of errors or unavailability, appropriate feedback messages are displayed to users.
- **Admin Interface:** An admin interface allows hotel staff to view and manage bookings, including editing and deleting existing reservations.

**3. Technology Stack:**
The booking system is built using the following technologies:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** PHP
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Server Environment:** Apache or Nginx
- **Development Tools:** Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code), web browser, MySQL Workbench (for database management)

**4. System Architecture:**
The system follows a client-server architecture, where the frontend interacts with the backend server to process booking requests and retrieve data from the database. The frontend is responsible for presenting the user interface and collecting user inputs, while the backend handles business logic, data processing, and database operations.

**5. Database Design:**
The database consists of tables to store booking information, room details, and other relevant data. The structure may include tables such as:
- **bookings:** Stores details of each booking, including arrival date, departure date, room type, number of guests, total price, etc.
- **rooms:** Contains information about available rooms, such as room type, capacity, price per night, etc.

**6. Deployment and Hosting:**
The booking system can be deployed on a web server running Apache or Nginx, with PHP support enabled. The database can be hosted on a MySQL server. Domain registration and hosting services may be required for online access.

**7. Pricing:**
The pricing for the full project depends on various factors such as development time, complexity, features, and additional requirements. Based on the estimated effort and market rates in the EU in 2024, the cost for developing and deploying the booking system could range from €5000 to €10000 or more. However, the actual price would need to be determined after detailed discussion and analysis of specific project needs.

**8. Conclusion:**
The booking system provides a seamless and efficient solution for managing hotel reservations, enhancing the overall booking experience for both users and hotel staff. With its user-friendly interface, real-time availability checking, and robust functionality, the system helps streamline the booking process and improve customer satisfaction.
